# First Post

This is my first post on this website where I will be posting about philosophy, reviews, interesting findings, both on the fiction and non-fiction sense. This is currently made with HUGO with [zzo's theme](https://github.com/zzossig/hugo-theme-zzo). I am basedly influenced by Luke Smith and Chris Titus by creating a minimal static website using Hugo, I am more of inspired as well to create my own but that'll be one of my projects in the near future. For now, I want to explore things and journal it as I go.
