# Restructuring my Computing Habits

The past year was my first year in college, I have experienced so many things, mistakes, failures and success but in the end, the intent was to learn and explore the world as I transition to my adulting era. Its been quite cumbersome to finally establish a working philosophy and principle that could help me get through in life as much as I have read Marcus Aurelius' Meditations at this early of an age. I would like to mix and balance my capabilities as a Computer Engineer Student, but I would like to do more than my title deems to be. I want to focus on learning in general but that includes non-computer engineering things. Overall this planning and general pursue to knowledge and wisdom necessitates deep concentration and basis on how to learn things in general. I base on productivity books and literature on how I can optimize my life to where I could see my potential in learning all of these things.

## Productivity

Judging from the Title of this Article, you know how Cal Newport inspired me to exercise my willpower and focus on some time, and create a system to optimize knowledge work. This will be difficult as I don't have the luxury of having a personal space yet but The computing systems that I am involved on the daily basis are a great offenders to my knowledge work and focus, hence I shall exploit this double edge sword by minimizing the effects of addictive behaviors of such systems by means of debloating and turning this systems to a minimal working condition that is both functional and productive.

## Linux and Offline Shill

For the Past year or so, I am "on-and-off" with the penguin. I have become of one of those people who will shill on free and open source software (FOSS) and their liberating aspects towards the consumer's right to own the devices. I plan to make my devices be liberated from an operating system standpoint. However, being in regards to a country that is heavily tied to M$, products and being a shill with them. It is difficult to find work/office work without some core functional knowledge of these tools especially on Office 365.

With the Rise of AI computing and integration. Our computers heavily being integrated by AI especially with Window's Announcement of AI Copilot integration on Win 11 and newer versions of it. This, in turn, makes the necessity to be always on the internet, hence, the computing requirement of having to be connected to the internet, which is a huge counter-intuitive knowledge value when we are talking about shallow and depth knowledge work from Newport's idea of Deep Work. Although the internet is a vast knowledge base, it is also worth mentioning that we need to have the right mindset and discipline in using the internet so we wouldn't dwell into: doom scrolling zombie mode, whenever we are searching the internet especially into social media sites.

## Economic Transactions with Data

The digital age today is run with Data, I am sold to the idea of being private and secure in general in the internet. As of now, I am mostly running FOSS to everything except to one of my laptop that has windows on it. That will be the only thing that will have proprietary software by the end of the year, aside from my desktop that I will talk about in the next section.

As a student, I am mostly keeping up with the sole generosity and care of my parents. I tried to have a job last year, a virtual assistance from a SEO company, but due to some circumstances it didn't went well with the scheduling, hence I resigned. I would like to find a similar job on the side, and surely enough I can find one this year, but in some cases I need to be strict with my spending and liabilities. I read about [Luke Smith's Minimizing Liabilities](https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/minimizing-liabilities-is-making-it/) and its one of the main reason I am mindful on the materialistic purchases I do. One of these tricks, of course, is to cooking one's [own meals](https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/no-restaurants-in-2023/), which I am guilty of since I sole justify my food as an exception to liabilities. I guess I need to watch out for my diet and consumption more. 

Online Services today are incredibly useful especially if they are free, but they are only free when your data is traded, Advertising IDs, watch duration consumption, algorithms, and such. This is the "Ad-Hoc" of the internet as it the current viable model for content creation. I am not gonna lie that I think this is good but I feel like I will be a pragmatic on this. If someone wants to support their content creator, I don't think anyone should be forced to view advertisement as the viewer should have the option if they want to support or not. The topic is complex and I am not a content creator myself, so best to leave it as anyone should do whatever. I just don't want them stealing/collecting my data unknowingly in the process.

## Gaming

My personal desktop at home runs Win 10, I plan to keep it that way until its EoL support, but I think recently that will change. The only game (League of Legends) I really enjoy playing, starts to implement their Intrusive Anti-cheat system (Vanguard) that snoop at the Kernel's Ring 0. This is a major security breach into systems that could potentially collect system information without the user's notice. Riot of course implemented this on Valorant at the very start but slowly I'm just not convinced that this system is any better than a pragmatic, consumer friendly approach of server-sided Anti-Cheat system like Valve's Anti-Cheat (VAC) System. My friends are starting to away from Riot Games, and thank god they are. But this, in turn, made me want to turn my home PC into a Linux based OS.

I want to move away from intrusive multiplayer games, into single player story based games, or Linux friendly multiplayer games. Hardware differences and purchases should be in mind when I shall make these changes like upgrading into an AMD GPU.

Overall, League of Legend's move into Vanguard AC is the final nail in the coffin to make my move into Linux. I would like to move away from gaming overall but I see my interest is slowly fading as long as I am away from the capabilities of playing video games. For now I'll just turn the Desktop PC into a General Desktop, XFCE or Plasma perhaps.
